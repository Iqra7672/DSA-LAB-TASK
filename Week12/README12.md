# Search Algorithms Comparison

This project demonstrates and compares two fundamental search algorithms: **Sequential Search** and **Binary Search**. It measures the number of comparisons performed during successful and unsuccessful searches over arrays of different sizes.

---

## Features

- Generates random integer arrays of various sizes.
- Performs **Sequential Search** to find a key.
- Performs **Binary Search** after sorting the array.
- Compares the number of comparisons made during:
  - Successful search (key exists in array).
  - Unsuccessful search (key not present in array).
- Outputs the results in a tabular format for analysis.
