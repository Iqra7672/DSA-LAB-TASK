Key Concepts

1. Complex Number Class (Example 1.2)
•	Concept: Demonstrates a custom class for complex numbers.
•	Key Features:
o	Constructors for initializing with real and imaginary parts.
o	Magnitude calculation using sqrt.
o	Overloaded + operator for addition.
o	Overloaded = operator for assignment.
o	Memory management with dynamic memory allocation (new and delete).

2. Exercise 1.1: Complex Number Multiplication
•	Concept: Extends the Complex class to support multiplication.
•	Key Features:
o	Overloaded * operator for multiplying two complex numbers.
o	Supports real and imaginary part multiplication.

3. Function Templates (Example 1.3)
•	Concept: Demonstrates the use of function templates.
•	Key Features:
o	Template function GetMax to find the maximum of two values.
o	Template allows functions to operate with different data types (e.g., int, long).

4. Class Template (Example 1.4)
•	Concept: A class template that operates with any data type.
•	Key Features:
o	Class mypair that stores a pair of values.
o	Template function getmax to return the larger of the two values.
o	Supports any data type.

5. Exercise 1.2: Class Template for Minimum Value
•	Concept: Extends the mypair class template to return the minimum value.
•	Key Features:
o	Template function getmin to return the lesser of the two values.
o	Similar to Example 1.4, but finds the minimum instead of maximum.

6. Class Template with Array Size (Example 1.5)
•	Concept: Introduces a class template with array size as a template parameter.
•	Key Features:
o	Class mysequence stores an array of size N.
o	Provides functions to set and get values from the array.
o	Demonstrates template usage for both data type and array size.

7. Exercise 1.3: Find Minimum and Maximum in Array
•	Concept: Extends the mysequence class template to find the minimum and maximum values.
•	Key Features:
o	findMin() and findMax() functions to find the smallest and largest elements in an array.
o	Works with both int and double data types.

8. File Handling: Counting Characters (Example 1.6)
•	Concept: Demonstrates file input/output operations.
•	Key Features:
o	Open input and output files (ifstream and ofstream).
o	Reads characters from a file and counts them.
o	Writes character count to an output file.

9. Exercise 1.4: Counting Characters, Words, and Sentences
•	Concept: File processing with additional word and sentence counting.
•	Key Features:
o	Counts characters, words, and sentences from an input file.
o	Uses file streams (ifstream and ofstream) for input and output.
o	Checks sentence delimiters (e.g., ., !, ?) to count sentences.

10. File Handling: Student Grades Calculation (Example 1.7)
•	Concept: Uses file input/output to read student data and calculate averages.
•	Key Features:
o	Reads student names and grades from an input file.
o	Calculates weighted averages for the students.
o	Writes the name and average to an output file.

11. Exercise 1.5: House Management System
•	Concept: Represents a simple house management system using a House class.
•	Key Features:
o	Uses class methods to read and store house information (owner, address, bedrooms, price).
o	Displays the entered data in a tabular format.

12. Exercise 1.6: Student Grades Management
•	Concept: Stores student names and grades, and calculates average grades.
•	Key Features:
o	Uses a Student class with methods to read grades from a file.
o	Calculates average grades and outputs them to a file.
o	Supports handling multiple grades for each student.
